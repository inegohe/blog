                <p>whenever someone talks about software developmet what comes to our minds is sophiscated blue code on large screens and some guy endless paucnhing at the keyboard doing whatever he's good at but that was completely deffrent when i first joined a call session with refacatory software developmet introductory course.</p>
                <p>The fascilitator seemed so casual that at first i thought i had joined the wrong call but i hadn't. He explained everything very to the extent that i thought in my head this guy really deserve a raise, he loves his job so much but ofcourse that not my decision to make right!</p>
                <p>Anyways the journey has been an intresting one since day one to the extented that we would look forawrd everyday to that zoom call. we learnt alot and you can be suprised at how th brain can grasp content one which you couldnt imagine having a capable mindspace for.</p>
                <p>Honestly can't to join the next class because this has really been nice and i know with such great fascilitators am sure to make a great software developer, kudos Refactory.</p>
