                <p class="ldg-para">What comes to your mind when one says they are a programmer. Well JavaScript has it all. From what I know it's all a beast until you discover it's vulnerability. JavaScript is script language that has undergone lots of updating well in an effort to try and make it's vulnerability less visible to the extent that there has been takeovers and handovers of the rights over the years.</p>
                <p>Let no one deceive you JavaScript is a kind fair language that has been affected by the injustices poised at code in the modern century definitely the 21st. Ooh sorry we in the 22nd century. This science of centuries has always been so low level for my understanding *pun intended.</p>
                <p>Well from my overall experience the best place to get a hold of the js syndrome and start living the code is refactory. Stay well as i keep you updated on this awesome adventure of coding or should I say programming!</p>
